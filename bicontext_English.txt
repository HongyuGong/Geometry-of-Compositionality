bottom line	even more so today; far from the scenario of ceos rushing to sign off on expensive it projects, motivated primarily by the terror of being late the party, business chiefs are asking more questions than ever before about the relationship between potential it projects and their value add to the bottom line so inquisitive are these ceos that kpmg found a gap in the marketplace for a product they call rapid business value analysis, a tool (still in pilot phase) used to evaluate a proposed technology--inside of 30 days--within the larger context of the company's business objectives
glass ceiling	enjoy sunshine and elegance in north london suburb if you're thinking of creating a sunroom at your house, a ceiling like this could usher in an abundance of northern sun. try a glass ceiling - use glass to striking effect with sliding glass doors and a chic, ultra-modern design it provides amazing natural light and a sleek but bold shape from above
glass ceiling	sticky floor -- noun, a condition in which women and minority men in entry level or low wage positions find themselves unable to advance: while the glass ceiling keeps a select group of women from government's top jobs, more than half of all women employed by state and local governments work on the sticky floor of low paying, low mobility jobs
leg up	a gait legged robots is the order and the direction of the leg movements. for example, a human has the following gait: lift left leg up, move left leg forward, put left leg down, shift weight to left leg, lift right up, move right leg forward, put right leg down, shift weight to right leg, and repeat. that's nine commands for two leges in one direction.
leg up	knowing what is likely to be hot well ahead of the crowd is a key element of successful early stage investing. helping ovp start ups gain access to resources within established industries gives them a leg up in the marketplace. they can focus on product development, gain access to global markets and capture key customers, said daniel petrozzo, managing director and head of technology infrastructure services at morgan stanley
old chestnut	for this reason chestnut wood is used extensively in the manufacture of tannin extract. some of the extract plant in pennsylvania use chestnut wood almost exclusively. old chestnut wood is richer in tannin than wood from young chestnut trees. analyses show that there is a higher percentage of tannin in the butt of a tree than in its top; also a higher percentage in dead than in living wood.
old chestnut	clare short has hit the news again after commenting that she still believed seminaked women on page three of certain newspapers should be banned she's a brave woman to stand up for what some believe is just a tired old chestnut and against the prejudice that brands anyone who pipes up against these semipornographic images killjoys it's not just about standards of decency or standards of journalism it's about how we portray women to a society where sex crimes and date rape seem to be on the increase and eating disorders are more common than ever
grass roots	 landscape design should provide adequate space for plants to minimize competition while shading is the most obvious form of competition, roots also compete below ground for water, nutrients, and space. the majority of fine, water absorbing tree and grass roots are in the top 6 inches of soil. in this region, roots ordinarily occupy a much greater percentage of the soil volume than tree roots and absorb more of the available water and nutrients especially around young trees however, grass root density is often much lower in areas where trees were established first
grass roots	but the focus of the evening was on zeanah, the flamboyant councilwoman whose unyielding views on development made her the charismatic leader of the slow growth movement, and the foe of those seeking more balance in city affairs you have been a force for the people, for the grass roots, said mary wiesbrock from save open space, one of the main local environmental groups fighting to preserve parkland in the conejo valley. you are our hero, the hero of the environment, the hero of the santa monica mountains
wild oats	process of competition between plants is a complex phenomenon, since many factors are involved in the development and its consequences in the case of competition and the traits that identify the source or the absorption and utilization of limited resources, they can determine, it is very important. wild oats and canary grass as the dominant weeds in wheat are known impact of weeds on various factors such as wheat and weed density, wheat varieties grown, the amount and timing of fertilize,  planting date and the other parts depend on ecological conditions
wild oats	yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to recognize, said vronsky. but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already. that's like scarlatina--one has to go through it and get it over. then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox. i was in love in my young days with a deacon  said the princess myakaya. i don't know that it did me any good.	
bad shape	i find its a lot better deal to buy a bundle of the right size boxes and keep some on hand. when they're on sale, i can get them at the local bigbox for a reasonable pricw i recycle whenever the materials are not in too bad shape. i have it stated in my policies that i use recycled materials when possible  i did not have a new box the right size, and ended up cutting and gluing paper on a box that i turned inside out 
bad shape	only one in five american voters rates the economy positively: 2 percent excellent and 19 percent good, according to a new fox news poll. instead, most think the economy's in bad shape: 46 percent only fair and 33 percent poor. that explains, at least in part, why voters say the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now:  32 percent say so, up from 21 percent in december
beats me	we run by the fire station and i can hear the crowd at the finish line. but as luck would have it, i just didn't have enough track or speed or a rock to throw to catch him. he beats me by about 10 feet. he finished 10 minutes ahead of me in the running race. my wife actually got worried and thought she might need to get the paramedics out for me.
beats me	his survival is really a big surprise for his family and friend. how should he explain all this? it beats me how he managed to survive alone in the mountains for three weeks, how he found water or food and how he found the way back
tighten belts	tightening a belt could be seen as temporary solution, but it generally works. while my suzuki swift has never squealed, i noticed that one of the belts has started to make a noise. so while i tighten belts on the car, i'll be taking photos so you can do the same. it's not as scary as it sounds and you can do it yourself if you have some basic tools and a free afternoon
tighten belts	that is generally the first place the call center manager might look to reduce costs. it is all too common to think of layoffs and reduction in staff as a way to respond to the call from senior management to tighten belts. but before you write up the pink slips, make sure you understand the implications of staff reductions. let's assume that you're a fairly small call center with fewer than 50 agent seats. if you're a larger center, you can view these numbers as representative of a specialized agent group within the bigger call center structure
beside yourself	fluid pale jelly, greasy tarts with pickled fruit, and solid trifle of flour and bread, all in greatest abundance. the only stranger present, beside yourself, is a courageous old bachelor, who stands away from the crowd and tastes a small sample of each, directly sending away his plate without dread of consequences: you see such thunder brows and lightning glances directed towards him
beside yourself	i take emotion as effect, it is the same as something affects you. it does something to you - it interferes with you. emotion is the thing that influences you greatly. you are beside yourself as if an explosion had crashed you. there is a quite tangible physiological condition which can be observed at the same time. so the difference would be this: feeling has no physical or tangible physiological manifestations
bite my tongue	tongue biting or tongue chewing is a common problem that affects a many people. to some, it happens while they are eating, taking or awake while to others, it happens at night while they are sleeping. i need some advice and i do not want to bite my tongue or the inside of my mouth when eating. the doctor says, sounds simple, but slow down. he explains that once an area has trauma, it is swollen and becomes much easier to re-injure. take your time and take it easy
bite my tongue	she says, that, as she was going out, she trod on a piece of orange skin; she fell down and hurt her foot. when a man does not reveal the truth, he lies; but i would bite my tongue ten times, before telling him: you lie, sir. he will not punish you this time, if you beg his pardon. they said that they would break our heads, but when they came to us, we pulled their eyes.
blank check	a bank also gives counter checks to customers when they run out of regular checks. counter checks have a high rate of fraud, and institutions should be careful when accepting them. a counter check is a blank check that does not contain a check number, a person's name or address. many counter checks also do not have an account number pre-printed on them. counter checks do have the bank's routing number on the bottom of the check.
blank check	it is clear that some presidential authorities in this context are beyond congress's ability to regulate. in any event, bush argues that congress already wrote him a blank check. as the president put it in a speech in january in kansas, congress gave me the authority to use necessary force to protect the american people, but it didn't prescribe the tactics.
wet blanket	they were using a variety of techniques including running back and forth from the house with buckets of water, using the back of a shovel and even placing a wet blanket on the back of the four wheeler and running over the flames. my husband has helped with three grass fires in his lifetime and knew that the best way is to use a bucket of water and a burlap bag
wet blanket	the spokesman said the united states has thus destroyed by itself, the missile technology control regime for preventing the worldwide proliferation of the ballistic missiles. it threw a wet blanket over the effort for restraint of long range missile launch and all other efforts for stability of the korean peninsula and its surrounding areas, and destroyed the foundation for dialogue and negotiations, he said. the spokesman also warned that washington's move will result in endangering the security of the u.s. mainland, far from ensuring it.
above board	in the old days, people who smuggled things always kept them hidden below deck. the legal cargo would be placed in plain sight on the deck. in other words, anything that was placed on the deck was considered above board it signifies the top deck, masts and sails, everything above the ship's boards, open to view.its origin has to do with the smuggling of good on ship.
above board	just keep quiet and go to the methodist church until you get big, and then you can go where you please. no, that wouldn't be honest, said peter sturdily. my aunt jane always said it was best to be open and above board in everything, and especially in religion. so i'll tell father right out, but i'll wait a few weeks so as not to spoil things for ma too soon if he acts up. peter was not the only one who had secret cares.
build bridges	the second video, fhwa works: building bridges faster and better to save you time and money, shows how ffiwa is working closely with state and local partners to build bridges faster and safer using accelerated bridge construction techniques. the video explains that accelerated construction techniques can minimize or even eliminate traffic jams, detours, and delay
build bridges	a delegation from the sharjah international book fair (sibf) has joined over 400 publishers from 35 countries in the 17th edition of algeria international book fair held at the exhibition palace in algiers to build bridges of communication with all parties involved in the arabic cultural movement and throw more light on arab writers and intellectuals
clean slate	i have a slate fireplace surround that makes my living room feel really warm and earthy, even if the fire is not lit. slate is a popular material in homebuilding.  i have done some research on how to clean slate in my home. first make sure to sweep, dust, or dry mop the surface to remove any loose dirt. mix a few drops of mild dish detergent in a couple of cups of warm water.
clean slate	responsible organizations now know that if they want to proactively take advantage of open source they have to play by the rules. to help the industry kick off 2006 with a clean slate, we are offering use of our protexip / ondemand system free of charge. this will give companies a clear picture of what open source they are already using
dance to	are they given any guarantee that these new dance steps will work with their new partners? no. they are asked to change their dancing, often with little practice, because after all, they should be able to dance to any music, any tempo, with any partner, and still be graceful. would imposed, regular dance lessons throughout their careers be a viable solution? as the music and partners change, so, too, do expectations
dance to	he asks them to imagine themseles in their arab neighbors' places, and is very much the angry schoolmaster when they don't dance to his tune or accept his pretense that this act of sympathetic imagination is devoid of political meaning. neither are the settleers, despite their experience in creating a well oiled publicity machine.
dead duck	china has done the same for japan because of the bird flu outbreak in yamaguchi prefecture. chinese health authorities and the world health organization said tuesday that a dead duck in the autonomous region had avian influenza, prompting a slaughter of 14,000 more ducks. china is also investigating suspected bird flu cases in hubei and hunan provinces. 
dead duck	all i would say to this ludicrous proposal is that when they get their business plan together, they should put it before the dragons' den i can just see the four entrepreneurs investing money in what most certainly from the very beginning would be a total dead duck and incidentally, business plans usually means that you can come up with a profit making scheme. i am awaiting with bated breath to find out how on earth a profit making scheme could come out of their venture
dead wood	buy a two or three year old plant with a clear stem of 10-15cm and plant in soil that has been dug over and weeds removed, to the same depth they were in their pots. if you are growing them as bushes, prune in winter, cutting out dead wood and any crossing branches and cut back by half any new growth shooting from the main branches. good varieties include leveller, which produces large yellow berries, careless, a mid season variety grown for its outstanding flavour, and invicta, a thorny type but with a good flavour
dead wood	it has left him intending to stand, with friends, for the borough council in 2007. he told the gazette: i intend standing and it makes me confident we can clear out some dead wood in the council. speaking about his opposition to the proposed development of the coatham enclosure, mr mcglade says he is encouraged by the response to his petition
deep pocket	after a moment's watchfulness, tibo tugged a pair of trousers from the first of the hangers provided by mr. kemanezic. sensible blue cloth, deep pocket, help lined to the knees, adjustable straps at the sides with black buttons to keep them in place. these were trousers. and they fitted. 
deep pocket	 while other factors contributed to the firm's demise, the overriding reason was the weight of its liability burden. according to former ceo robert levine, l&h, like other accounting firms, was included as a defendant because of the perception of being a deep pocket rather than deficiencies in the performance of its professional responsibilities. it wasn't the litigation we would lose that was the problem, he asserted. it was the cost of winning that caused the greatest part of our financial distress
go downhill	pass through a line of trees, and go right on the edge of another larger field. at the end of this clearing, the trail splitsï¼Œ with the yellow blazed pine loop going left; go downhill, entering the woods and folloing the blue blazes. continue straight to a second junction with a yellow blazed trail. go left on blue boundary trail, and follow under mixed hardwoods
go downhill	since none of the nominees was identified -- bewildering bit. still, everything that followed surpassed it. given that many oscar ceremonies begin with a killer opening only for everything to go downhill from there, sunday's telecast was a refreshing change of pace. song, dance and even a tambourine played a part at the oscars sunday night. host ellen degeneres, left, danced a jig in honor of the nominees while, above from left, jack black, john c. reilly and will ferrell, from left, sang of their oscar aspirations. 
eagle eye	an eagle head is about as big as your hand, but their eyes are bigger than yours. a human's eye is about one inch long. an eagle eye is almost one and a half inches long. eagles have large eyes because they need to see well. they fly very high in the sky, but they eat small animals that live on the ground. an eagle needs to see those small animals from far away.
eagle eye	the whole population of rochester and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning, in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement. a grand review was to take place upon the lines. the manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by the eagle eye of the commander in chief; temporary fortifications had been erected, the citadel was to be attacked and taken, and a mine was to be sprung
fishing expedition	there are many possibilities, ranging from the simple hook and line to working with all the complex gear of deep sea fishing expedition. fishing is popular with both bahamians and tourists. these large eyed, very bony fish can weigh from 5 to 10 pounds and be more than a foot long. they are challenging to catch as they never stay in one place long and are extremely sensitive to sound.
fishing expedition	sometimes there is a perfectly good and valid reason for looking into someone else's records, and sometimes they reveal material that is highly relevant. but that is a minority of cases, probably a small minority. and usually, as i say, it's a fishing expedition to see if you can find some dirt to throw at the complainant. a barrier who mostly defended in sex cases, confirmed that fishing expeditions were regularly made by defence counsel and also stated that there was frequently no problem in getting them through.
free ride	however, should you drive and then find that you have had too much to drink, make a call to discount cab to take advantage of their program for the fourth of july holiday, as well as the weekend before. the programoffers patrons of a free ride back to their cards the next day. last year, arizona police pulled over 11,200 cards and made more than 500 dui arrests over the weekend. area residents wanting to take advantage of the program can call 602-200-2000 in phoenix and 520-200-2000 in tucson. 
free ride	others benefit when a participant contributes, pays his fees or taxes. all are, nevertheless, better off in the long run if they all pay the cost and resist the temptation to free ride on the contributions of others. in this type of social dilemma the kind of cooperation and contribution serving the group interest is actively giving while it is in the individual's private interest not to give.
front runner	they seem to hold their speed longer. their come from behind rivals have more difficulty catching them. therefore, when the handicapper's study shows that the best horse in the race is a front runner, and that no other runner in the race has the speed to stay with him, the horse usually becomes a better bet on a sloppy track.
front runner	obama, who is in a head to head fight with hillary clinton, met senator edwards at his home in north carolina. edwards left the contest last month and both clinton and obama have been wooing his supporters since. obama is currently the front runner, having won the last eight democrat primaries. there are two more today in wisconsin and hawaii, the tropical island where obama was born. john mccain, who has all but clinched the nomination, said he was confident of beating whoever wins the democrat race in the november presidential election
high horse	nearly all my memories of horses, however, are happy ones. feeling like a little king, i could see all the world from the top of that high horse. i was always eager to feed the horses and pet them. i longer for the day when i could drive a team in the field by myself. dad saw my keen interest in horses and encouraged me to take the lines.
high horse	miss ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime. she appeared to be on her high horse tonight; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed
hold water	no matter which way you turn the sponge, or what surface you leave the sponge to drain on, it always ends up holding the same height of water. the potting soil in the container is able to hold water, exactly the same way that the bath sponge does. it doesn't matter what surface the soil happens to be sitting on. so even if the soil is sitting on top of a layer of drainage material it will always hold a certain height of water.
hold water	just what one might have expected you to do, said mr prosser, unkindly. young man, i begin to believe that there may be something in this. you haven't got a ghost of a proof that would hold water in a court of law, of course; but still, i'm inclined to believe you. for one thing, you haven't the intelligence to invent such a story. in fact, if you can answer me one question i shall be satisfied
off color	this is next to impossible to entirely remove from the fabric being cleansed, and tends to throw the clothes off color when subjected to the hot iron. just a word regarding the old disputed subject of soaking clothes before washing them. 
off color	no amount of social concern or open discussion can change that fact. third, and perhaps the greatest reason for inter-gender disputes, women want respect from men. disrespect for women has always been a problem in the area of sexual attraction and lust. however, sexual harassment and off color humor are only part of the picture. women want respect in their gender roles, too. women want recognition of their intelligence, multi-dimensional nature, dependability, stability, good judgment, and skills
shed light	wand came up beside them and stared. the wonderful light, shining up rather than down as the sun would have shed light on what lay beneath it, emanated from the valley, sparkling on trees as tall and green as any in the forests near bendwillow.
shed light	the last sentence is perhaps the most famous in the origin, since it alone concerns human evolution. it would be easy for us to assume that darwin meant the natural selection would shed light on the origin of man and his history; but that assumption would be ill founded. the often quoted passage comes in the context of a discussion of common descent and the mutability of species.
lock horns	most bulls seem capable of deciding who has the tenacity, experience, or brute strength to prevail. occasionally, bulls inflict serious injury or lock horns, but it is rare. bulls may also size each other up all year long for body strength, as head to head shoving matches are witnessed in the winter on any refuge.
lock horns	initially wallace accepted darwin's idea without reservation, but he grew skeptical about sexual selection as the decade progressed. he and darwin would repeatedly lock horns over the relative importance of this form of selection, and their differing viewpoints signaled the beginning of a permanent schism.
look out	how glad we are that many centuries ago the old romans invented transparent window glass and we can thus enjoy light and air a sight of many interesting things as we look out of the window. let us see what we can observe: trees, houses, people, automobiles, dogs, sky, clouds, smoke, etc.
look out	why does it prompt birds to land? because the bird is in the open. somebody just shouted an alarm. danger! look out! without better intelligence, few birds want to risk being the only obvious target in the sky the warning could, after all, relate to the presence of a falcom.
more than	i remember the days of the great stan seymour and the cup wins. in those days the team wore their shirt with pride. having supported newcastle for more than 50 years i am despondent about the current state of affairs. these days it's all about money and the player is only loyal to the club that will pay the most wages
more than	will was entitled to feel unlucky after broch keeper billy gordon pulled of a string of super saves to deny the home side victory. but after the disappointment of their scottish cup defeat last week he was more than satisfied with his team's performance. he said: the boys were always going to be judged by how they played today. last week at spartans they let everyone down. we made six changes today and i was delighted with the performance and the commitment of the players
nest egg	nests are carefully monitored to ensure an egg's development. the number of eggs removed from a nest is also noted, for birds lay additional eggs when nest egg numbers decline. hunters also know how many eggs to taken from a nest. depending upon the bird, when one or two eggs remain, production continues, ensuring a food supply - and plenty of baby birds.
nest egg	employees were far more receptive to the idea of a guaranteed investment vehicle than were those currently retired, with one third of workers indicating they would allocate 25% to 49% of their retirement nest egg to an investment that provides a guaranteed amount of retirement income every month, compared to only 13% of retirees. another third of employees said they would allocate 50% to 74% of their retirement deposit to a guaranteed investment vehicle
no picnic	on tuesday matt told george all about the picnic trip to the beach. he also told how he felt as he watched the couple walk toward the sand dunes with a blanket but no picnic lunch. i bet they were going there to have fun. how was your holiday? did you go on a picnic?
no picnic	he was someshow not awarded a second victoria cross fro his heroism in this fight. it was obvious that the division's tour in the front line would be no picnic. over the next few days, the advance companies of the 16th and 13th battalions moved forward to back up the 4th brigade's other two battalions and prepare to continue the drive towards thiepval.
on ice	the blade of an ice skate has an upside down u shape. its two thin edges rest on the ice with great pressure. skating on ice is really skating on a very thin film of water. increasing the pressure of a substance makes its temperature rise. so the ice melts into water for a split second as the skate goes over it. 
on ice	the article boasted that the guardian shed would have an armchair cinema so two years on, how's that working out? not all that well actually. the paper's new editor katharine viner has put the project on ice following a 'strategic review of guardian media group's business' alongside david pemsel. it appears the pair decided that spending millions on the project wasn't the best idea given that they are predicted to have an annual loss of more than 40 million dollars
open door	let them know you taking me. we walked silently along the street to where he had parked the car sed open door for me and gestured for me to get into the hourse, and then after he carefully closed the car door he walked around to the driver's side and got in and started the engine
open door	so before we read on, i want to do a little evaluating for you. so, now look at the bottom part. this is where i really open door to my thinking and explain what went on inside of my head when i read that. i thought about how people say to me no way! when they are really surprised
paper tiger	while the papers were for chinese americans, the vendor carried as a sideline paper tiger, which was made of paper and were traditional chinese toy, but most were probably bought by tourists visiting the inexpensive restaurants and stores in chinatown
paper tiger	i disagree with prince turki al-faisal bin abdul-aziz, the former head of the saudi general intelligence services and former ambassador to the united states and england, who described iran, in a lecture in a jordanian university, as a paper tiger and said that its political regime and leadership is weak and fragile. maybe prince turki had reasons that justified this description in the past
on paper	i hate writing with a pencil, so i use pens, and everything is scribbled out. for the practice sats, students are required to write on paper. accustomed to writing on a computer, many struggle when longhand is required. emily and her classmates have been using computers since grade three
on paper	real estate investors with proven track records have no problems finding lenders eager to loan them money. until you achieve plantinum status, however, you'd better look good on paper. you need to demonstrate that you have a solid income from your day job, money in the bank, investments, or assets that you can sell
pay dividends	its check n go chain of pay day loan stores, judge norbert nadel today issued an opinion and an order enjoining the cincinnati based cng financial from paying further dividends or borrowing money to pay dividends. allen davis filed the lawsuit in which the order was issued in 2004 after his sons, david davis and jared davis, seized control of the company and began a series of multimillion dollar payouts with borrowed funds
pay dividends	any child who did not look likely to conform to the rules was not admitted. by such efforts church organizations progressed. but all this ancillary effort pay dividends in terms of attendance? cox, in his study, has noted that the churches with the most successful record of resisting decline were those with the most successful arrangements. 
rotten apple	provide an easy and quick snack to be consumed on the go. examining your apples -- by smell and sight and feel -- for signs of damage or spoilage before you eat them will help you avoid biting into a rotten apple. when you're shopping for apples at the grocery store, perform an initial quality check of the package can help you avoid a bag of bad apples. look for a packing date or a best before date on the package or bag clip
rotten apple	darron whitehead, defending, said smith had little recollection of the crimes - committed over just 30 days - because of his drinking and drug taking. smith, a father of one, finally recognised he had been a thoroughly rotten apple. he had gone firmly off the rails and did not realise he was out of control. mr whitehead said smith was finally coming to his senses and knew he had to change his ways if he was to stay out of trouble
same page	encoded her message using alphabetical substitutions keyed into the first eight letters of the top line of that page. to read the message, eden has to check the date and turn to the same page so she could reconvert those substitutions to the letters of the plain text. without the psychology book as reference, the code was virtually unbreakable by anyone else without a computer
same page	who had great vision and never were able to follow through successfully. how do we organize all the different people with all different personalities, goals, mindsets, and perspectives? we all have to be on the same page: working toward the same goals. effective leaders do this. first is vision. picture a cross country race with several high school teams. my team would drive to a remote school
see red	the brain then assimilates the red, blue violet, and green impulses and mixes them into a single message that informs us of the color being viewed. when we see red, for example, this is becasue the red-sensitive cones are activated while the green and blue violet ones are relatively dormant. keep in mind that objects emit many colored wavelengths
see red	a product of the jim crow south who in the 1960s opened his churchâ€™s basement to civil rights leaders and students who organized lunch counter sit-ins in north carolina. lynch's father see red? lynch was angry with the historically long 166-day wait for the vote. but his impatience was tempered by the knowledge that itâ€™s been a full 50 years since the civil rights act
smoke signals	smoke can also be used to obscure enemy communications or to send deceptive signals. smoke bombs can be sent by means of artillery or dropped from airplanes. smoke signals are still used today in fire and rescue work as well as some military missions. the use is one feature of survival training in the military. indeed, one can purchase colored smoke signal devices and smoke grenades on the open market.
smoke signals	on my birthday, someone managed to pick up an errant blackberry signal or perhaps a drumbeat, and we heard that rumsfeld had resigned. for my sixtieth, i hope to get smoke signals that george is to appear before the international war crimes tribunal. impeachment is too good for him. africa is so stunningly beautiful, you can see why those chilled, old, white europeans just had to have it. the long range effects of their colonizing--genocide, civil war, illiteracy, poverty, environmental havoc--foretell the dire, long range consequences of boy george's colonizing binge in iraq. 
same boat	since the building of this dam there has not been a single new boat put on the river. prior to the builidng of this dam the upper mississippi river was being navigated by identically the same boat that now navigated the river. all the boats were nagivated on that part of the river in perfect safety between keokuk and alton at the time congress granted this authority
same boat	i am part of a much larger family. a family that could have appreciated my confused state of detachment and loss, because these guys are all in the same boat as me. there are always my brothers and sisters ready and willing to embrace me in a foreign land. those singaporean expatriates all ready to muck in together
thin line	the graph describes decay in relations the effect of direct structural embedding is illustrated by comparing lines across the graphs. the thin line in figure 6 is lower than the line in figure 7. the thick line in figure 6 is lower than its counterpart in figure 7. in short, bridges decay faster
thin line	he is a man of integrity and high ideals, but he can not translate these ideals into his public actions. instead, he deteriorates. shakespeare shows that there is only a thin line between brutus's heroic goals and his far less admirable pride. his pride - his character flaw - makes him a tragic figure. it also leads him to behave arrogantly and foolishily
thin ice	in very cold winter, people usually stayed indoors to keep warm. everything outside is covered by ice and snow, andrew had been skating on thin ice. the ice has cracked and he had found himself in deep water, with killer whales closing in. then miraculously, someone had thrown him a lifeline. so he had grabbed it
